                                Haze effect on the settings page is broke, not exactly sure why, looking into fixing it. Getting real links to seperate pages set up for the installer menu. The keypads for the 
                                installer and settings menu currently do not work with the keyboard keypresses but I should have this working soon. The Silent exit and entry delay also doesn't return to gray when 
                                unchecked, still working on this one too. Weather and time on the homepage are being looked into, I will do more with this when I start looking into ADC modifications to what the 
                                panel can do/show.

                                users screen. Set up list of priorities so I can focus on getting the program set up in order to make everything go faster. Since the edit users page doesn't work I have made it so
                                new users have system access without setting it up because that part isn't finished yet.

                                page. I also need to rework the verify  users page to accept any 4 digit code but send you back to first enter user code if they don't match to have you try again. Those should be the 
                                last things left on the users. Next step is getting the states of the panel set up.

                                I have one section of the programming interpretation left to finish and update so JS can read it correctly. After that I will be finishing the functions of all the buttons on the screen of the page. Once finished, I will move on to actually editing the sensor programming.

                                Working on getting the page to update what it shows when I update the returns. Not updating after first instance need to look into a way to make sure that the function re-returns itself. Once completed and working will move onto editing the programming and implimenting alarms into the panel.

                                Its a new year! I've also made a ton of progress on edit programming for wireless sensors, they now are all viewable and you can even type in serial number section. One of my longer updates but I have done quite a bit today, turned the edit page from a awful mess into looking how its supposed to. Next step is gettting it to actually work...

                                The serial number invalid entry page is the next step to style. I also need to figure out why my defaultCheck on my checkboxes isn't working. I also need to rewrite my redux for how I store my programming and temp programming. After the whole page is working I then need to create the save page to wipe temp programming data and either save it or delete it depending on what is chosen. The home and emergency buttons also need to be reworked a bit to not work when in installer toolbox.
