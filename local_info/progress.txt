Working On:
*updating everything to work with React
*event listener key press for keypad
*haze on users screen
*event listener for keypresses for keyboard and keypad for code
*edit page for users, master and duress
*keyboard starts on shift then leaves after typing in a letter.
*update verify code page to accept any 4 digit code but only move forward if correct
*Update values on arming spheres back to original upon countdown finishing

To Do:
*Arm Pages
*alarm
*Smart Home Controls Page
*Smart Areas Page
*System Info page
*Make the text by the sliders gray out when not active
*Implement a script to keep track of what state the panel is in (armed away, disarmed, armed stay, not ready to arm, etc)
*Implement a script to keep track of correct led color for buttons(outside ones) and have them go gray when being pressed on
*have each sensor and automation programed in
*screen timeout function
*Home screen weather/time
*make a note on the language page about the system not being supported in Other languages at this time
*simplify redundant code like header with php
*organize style sheet into multiple dependant on what it is applying to or just organizing everything into sections so its easy to find.
*keyfobs trying to arm when armed and disarm when disarmed screens
*home and emergency buttons do not work while in installer toolbox
*keyfobs don't arm/disarm when in installer toolbox
*When press home button when armed returns to home armed screen

Look into:
*saving settings/users/sensors through login or browser cache
*have options to remove/add gsm, power cycle, hard reset, etc.
*switching so each page is seperate html page(if faster speed required)
*having sounds or display of sounds
*having php to replace which screen is showing
*sidebar sensors, keyfobs, automation, etc when clicked shows a dropdown of all the options and when clicked again retracts
*limit to max of sensors that can be programmed in to 10
*limit max custom user codes to 10

Bugs to look at:
*fix haze on settings
*when a code isn't active the text is grayed out is not working when switched to a tag
*incorrect codes on arming screens

3. Getting sensors working (1 of each kind) - 0%
4. Getting Automation working (1 of each kind) - 0%
5. Anything left on Home screen - 0%
6. Anything left in System Settings - 0%
7. Anything left in Installer Toolbox - 0%
8. Other Features (screen-timeout) - 0%
8. Lots of testing - 5%
